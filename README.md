DerelictUtil
============
Derelict is a group of D packages which provide bindings to a number of C libraries. The bindings are dynamic, in that they load shared libraries at run time. __DerelictUtil__ is the common code base used by each package. It provides a cross-platform mechanism for loading shared libraries, exceptions that indicate failure to load, and common declarations that are useful across multiple platforms.
